# Hand-Gesture-Recognier

My Environment for this:
OS: Windows 10,
Python: version 3.6.4,
OpenCV: version 3.1.4,

Libraries Used: OpenCV, numpy, math

How this works:
1. Run the .py file, it'll open your camera
2. Put your hand in the box shown in the camera
3. Gestures will be: Best of luck, ok and count the number of fimger you show
